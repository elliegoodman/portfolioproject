  <p class="project-title">Business Analytics Capstone Project</p>
  <p class="project-description">The University of Iowa's Hospitals and Clinics are some of the best in the nation and the best in the state of Iowa. Since the beginning of the Covid-19 Pandemic, our hospitals and clinics have had problems with their patients' length of stays. Recently, the University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics have faced an average patient length of stay that is 2.5 days longer than the national average, they are also facing bed shortages and staffing issues. I had the opportunity to use Epic, the University's electronic health record system, and Slicer Dicer, Epic's data exploration tool to analyze any variables that may be related to a patient's extended stay.

  <p class="project-title">Computational Thinking Project</p>
  <p class="project-description">Have you ever wondered if certain characteristics can help protect you from Covid-19? By analyzing a diverse range of patient data encompassing factors such as sex, patient type, age, diabetes, obesity, asthma, pneumonia, and classification, this project sought to unravel the nuanced interplay between these variables and the disease outcome. Through sophisticated statistical modeling and data analysis techniques, this project not only provided insights into the demographic and clinical characteristics of COVID-19 patients but also generated predictive models capable of estimating survival probabilities based on individual patient profiles. This endeavor represents a crucial step towards enhancing our understanding of COVID-19 and facilitating more targeted and personalized approaches to patient care and management.

  <p class="project-description">Imagine if Netflix and Spotify were one app. My project in my Business Communication and Protocol class allowed me to explore compelling concept of Netflix acquiring Spotify, envisioning the potential synergies and benefits that such a strategic move could yield. By delving into the intricacies of this hypothetical acquisition, I analyzed how it could enhance revenue streams, elevate customer satisfaction, and facilitate company expansion for both entities. Through thorough market research and strategic analysis, I identified key opportunities for cross-promotion, content integration, and platform diversification that could amplify value for users and stakeholders alike. This project underscored the transformative potential of strategic partnerships in the digital entertainment landscape, illuminating avenues for innovation and growth in an ever-evolving industry.
