  <p class="project-title">Business Analytics Capstone Project</p>
  <p class="project-description"> The University of Iowa's Hospitals and Clinics are some of the best in the nation and the best in the state of Iowa. Since the beginning of the Covid-19 Pandemic, our hospitals and clinics have had problems with their patients' length of stays. Recently, the University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics have faced an average patient length of stay that is 2.5 days longer than the national average, they are also facing bed shortages and staffing issues. I had the opportunity to use Epic, the University's electronic health record system, and Slicer Dicer, Epic's data exploration tool to analyze any variables that may be related to a patient's extended stay. Read more about the analysis of UIHC's patient length of stay issue through the link below. </p>

  <p class="project-title">Operations Management Project</p>
  <p class="project-description">Covid-19 affected the restaurant industry in many different ways, presenting unprecedented challenges that reverberated throughout the supply chain and operational processes. Amid the pandemic, the restaurant sector grappled with a myriad of issues, including supply chain disruptions, loss of income, and widespread closures. As businesses faced unprecedented challenges, it became evident that innovative operational strategies were essential for survival.
    Focusing on the profound impact of supply chain disruptions, income losses, and business closures, this project focuses on adaptive strategies such as the exploration of operational process shifts.
