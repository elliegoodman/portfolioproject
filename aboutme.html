        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p> Hello everyone! My name is Ellie Goodman and I am a current senior at the University of Iowa studying Business Analytics and Information Systems through the Tippie College of Business. Although I grew up in the Des Moines area, my family and I moved to Pittsburgh, PA where I finished my highschool education. I loved Iowa so much, I travelled back to attend University. Throughout my time here on campus, I have joined a few organizations, held a few positions within organizations, and met some amazing people! Although I am sad to see my college journey come to an end, I am excited and honored to have recently accepted a job post-graduation.
